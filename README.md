# Noise Detector

https://noise-detector.vercel.app/

This project was created by Bright Li, Maz, Scott Chiang, and Thomas Wu at [The Summit](https://summit.hackclub.com/), a high school CS club leader hackathon held by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) at San Francisco during February 9th-11th, 2024.

## Hackathon Prompt

The hackathon's prompt is to build a project that will be used by the attendee's CS club regularly.

This project is a web application that measures noise level in decibels. When the noise level exceeds 85db, it plays a baby crying sound. We plan to use this in our club meetings to make sure it doesn't get too noisy during conversations.
